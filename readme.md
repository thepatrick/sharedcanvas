Shared Canvas
=============

Shared Canvas is a test project to show what is drawn on one device on many others, who can also draw.

Drawing is currently only supported on devices that support touch events (such as iOS devices or recent Android phones/tablets), and the requires <canvas> support to both draw and view.
  
Clearing the canvas currently requires restarting the server, and resizing the <canvas> element requires reloading the page (which then replays any drawing since the server started, so doesn't cause data loss).
  
Things to do:

1) Support multiple drawings
2) The canvas tag on one device may be bigger than others, so any drawing done outside of the visible area of those smaller devices won't be visible to them.
3) Support changing colour
4) Add an eraser of some kind
5) Add a reset
6) Show how many people are connected
7) Include headers so it can be added to the home screen on iOS devices as a chrome-less web app.
