            SharedCanvas is simple, just type (or tap in!) the name of a canvas
            and go - you don't need to create it first. Tell someone else the
            name and they enter it and everything shows up (in real time!) 
            for them too.
          </p>
          <p>
            To draw you need a touch device (e.g. and iOS or Android device),
            but your drawings can be viewed in many modern browsers (Safari,
            and Chrome definitely work, Firefox should, IE9 ought to as well).
          </p>
          <p>
            Drawings will only persist as long as the server isn't rebooted:
            this is still an experimental service!
          </p>
